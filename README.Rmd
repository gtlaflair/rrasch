# rrasch

This packagee provides functions for planning a Rasch analysis using Linacre's Facets program.


The function "rate_plan" will create a linked dataset for testing a Rasch design in Facets. Based on response, task, rater, and number of rating parameters the function will distribute tasks to raters in a manner that will create indirect links among the raters. If the benchmarks argument is used, the indirect links will be supplemented with a common set of linking tasks for all raters.
