The function "cal_plan" (see the R directory) will randomly sample the specified number of performances
from each of the raters in your dataset. Then it will redistribute those performance to other raters for the purpose of calibration sessions and Rasch analysis in Facets. It outputs eight files automatically.

1. A visual of the unlinked data
2. A table of how the data was originally collected
3. An unlinked dataset to test for subset connection in Facets
4. An index table for diagnostic checking. To be used if you believe
the reassignment did not work correctly
5. A calibration plan table. This table will show which examiners
get which performance. The first column will indicate the orginal
plan and the next k columns will indicate the assignments for each
calibration session.
6. A linked dataset with random scores to verify the subset connection
in Facets.
7. A visual table of the linking plan.
8. A second visual table of the linking plan
